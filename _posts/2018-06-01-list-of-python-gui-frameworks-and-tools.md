Even though python is not really known for it’s GUI-Applications, there is still a huge number of GUI frameworks or toolkits out there. If you started working with python, chances are high you got past the very basic of GUI frameworks out there: “Tkinter”. Usually the Tkinter-package is bundled with python itself and is defined as the standard GUI package. Working with it is simple, fast and pretty much self explaining after you got into it for some minutes. But what about the others? I created a short list of frameworks I worked with in the past and some I only know by name. These frameworks will be categories into their supporting platforms, so it will be easier to for you to find something suiting for your personal project.
